Hello this is my "Tweets" test project.
Technologies used here: React, ModuleCSS, Redux, RTK, RTKQuery, axios, ReactRouter

Bundle created by me + create-react-app

Home page -
Written by using axios and component lifecycle hooks

Tweet page -
Written by using RTKQuery and Redux
Firstly i was using pure react-hooks but after probem with caching and optimising components render decided to rewrite to Redux + RTKquery

Components and elements styled via ModuleCSS
